# Sequencer64 0.94.0 (and above) rc configuration file
#
# This file holds the main configuration options for Sequencer64.
# It follows the format of the legacy seq24 'rc' configuration
# file, but adds some new options, such as LASH, Mod4 interaction
# support, an auto-save-on-exit option, and more.  Also provided
# is a legacy mode.
#
# The [comments] section can document this file.  Lines starting
# with '#' and '[' are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.  Show a
# blank line by adding a space character to the line.

[comments]

(Comments added to this section are preserved.  Lines starting with
 a '#' or '[', or that are blank, are ignored.  Start lines that must
 be blank with a space.)


[midi-control]

# The leftmost number on each line here is the pattern number, from
# 0 to 31 (and beyond for the mute-groups). Next, there are three
# groups of bracketed numbers that follow:
#
#    [toggle]  [on]  [off]
#
# In each group, there are six numbers:
#
#    [on/off invert status d0 d1min d1max]
#
# 'on/off' enables/disables (1/0) the MIDI control for the pattern.
# 'invert' (1/0) causes the opposite if data is outside the range.
# 'status' is by MIDI event to match (channel is NOT ignored).
# 'd0' is the first data value.  Example: if status is 144 (Note On),
# then d0 represents Note 0.
# 'd1min'/'d1max' are the range of second values that should match.
# Example:  For a Note On for note 0, 0 and 127 indicate that any
# Note On velocity will cause the MIDI control to take effect.

# Handling of mute-groups.  If set to 0, a legacy value, then

[midi-clock]

# The first line indicates the number of MIDI busses defined.
# Each buss line contains the buss (re 0) and the clock status of
# that buss.  0 = MIDI Clock is off; 1 = MIDI Clock on, and Song
# Position and MIDI Continue will be sent, if needed; 2 = MIDI
# Clock Modulo, where MIDI clocking will not begin until the song
# position reaches the start modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks].
# A value of -1 indicates that the output port is totally
# disabled.  One can set this value manually for devices that are
# present, but not available, perhaps because another application
# has exclusive access to the device (e.g. on Windows).

[midi-meta-events]

# This section defines some features of MIDI meta-event handling.
# Normally, tempo events are supposed to occur in the first track
# (pattern 0).  But one can move this track elsewhere to accomodate
# one's existing body of tunes.  If affects where tempo events are
# recorded.  The default value is 0, the maximum is 1023.
# A pattern must exist at this number for it to work.

0    # tempo_track_number

[midi-input]

1   # number of input MIDI busses

# The first number is the port number, and the second number
# indicates whether it is disabled (0), or enabled (1).

# Input buss name: [0] 0:0 seq64 midi in 0
0 1  # buss number, input status

# If set to 1, this option allows the master MIDI bus to record
# (filter) incoming MIDI data by channel, allocating each incoming
# MIDI event to the sequence that is set to that channel.
# This is an option adopted from the Seq32 project at GitHub.

0   # flag to record incoming data by channel

[manual-alsa-ports]

# Set to 1 to have sequencer64 create its own ALSA ports and not
# connect to other clients.  Use 1 to expose all 16 MIDI ports to
# JACK (e.g. via a2jmidid).  Use 0 to access the ALSA MIDI ports
# already running on one's computer, or to use the autoconnect
# feature (Sequencer64 connects to existing JACK ports on startup.

1   # flag for manual ALSA ports

[reveal-alsa-ports]

# Set to 1 to have sequencer64 ignore any system port names
# declared in the 'user' configuration file.  Use this option if
# you want to be able to see the port names as detected by ALSA.

0   # flag for reveal ALSA ports

[interaction-method]

# 0 - 'seq24' (original seq24 method)
# 1 - 'fruity' (similar to a certain fruity sequencer we like)

1   # interaction_method

# Set to 1 to allow Sequencer64 to stay in note-adding mode when
# the right-click is released while holding the Mod4 (Super or
# Windows) key.

0   # allow_mod4_mode

# Set to 1 to allow Sequencer64 to split performance editor
# triggers at the closest snap position, instead of splitting the
# trigger exactly in its middle.  Remember that the split is
# activated by a middle click.

0   # allow_snap_split

# Set to 1 to allow a double-click on a slot to bring it up in
# the pattern editor.  This is the default.  Set it to 0 if
# it interferes with muting/unmuting a pattern.

# jack_transport - Enable slave synchronization with JACK Transport.
# Also contains the new flag to use JACK MIDI.

# Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface forces this,
# and also disables jack_master_cond).

# jack_master_cond - Sequencer64 is JACK master if no other JACK
# master exists. Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface
# forces this, and disables jack_master).

# song_start_mode (applies mainly if JACK is enabled).

# 0 = Playback in live mode. Allows muting and unmuting of loops.

# Note that, if auto-save is set, many of the command-line settings,
# such as the JACK/ALSA settings, are then saved to the configuration,
# which can confuse one at first.  Also note that one currently needs
# this option set to 1 to save the configuration, as there is not a
